1. If there is no branch available in the repository, we need to run the complete push command.

#Error Received when I ran "git push" command.

git push
fatal: The current branch Ujjawal27-07-2019 has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin Ujjawal27-07-2019

Running the suggested command worked.
