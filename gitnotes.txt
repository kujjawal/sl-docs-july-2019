# VCS using Git
######################

Keywords:

.deb => debian, Ubuntu, Suse
.rpm => RHEL, CentOS, Fedora

Software Development after application has been released:
  - Features/Enhancement
  - Bug-fixes/hot-fixes
- Service Packs (Microsoft) / Bundle release (VMware ESXi) / Patch release (in Oracle)


Agenda:

- Why SCM/VCS?
- Distributed vs Centralized
- Git Introduction
- Installation and Configuration
- Standard Operations in Git => Git Commands


SCM => Source Code Management
VCS => Version Control System

Centralized => SVN, TFS, Accurev, Perforce, Clear Case
Distributed => Git, Mercurial, Bazaar,

Linux => RedHat, Ubuntu, Debian, Suse
Git => GitLab, BitBucket, GitHub, CodeCommit, SmartGit, TortoiseGit.

Licenses: MIT, Apache 2.0

GitHub  => Public Repos
        => Private Repos

SVN Trunk = GIT Master = TFS Main
SVN Commit = Git Push

*************************

Why SCM/VCS?

  - Collaboration
  - Centralized Code Management
  - Versioning
  - Automatic backups
  - Branching capabilities (Parallel Development)
  - Auditing (investigation)

*************************

Types of VCS:

  Local (Filesystem)         => SCCS, RCS
  Centralized                => SVN, TFS, Accurev, Perforce
  Distributed                => Git, Mercurial

Centralized vs Distributed:
- In Centralized VCS, you need to be connected to the Server in order to perform any operation. Whereas that is not needed in case of Git DVCS.
- In CVCS you need to have a Centralized server. Whereas, thats not needed in a DVCS.


=============================
Installation and Configuration
=============================

Official page: https://git-scm.com/

Installation Commands:

sudo apt-get install git ## Ubuntu/Debian
sudo yum install git  ## CentOS/RHEL

For Windows or Mac, follow instructions given on the official Git page.

git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

=============================
Git Commands
=============================

git init
git status
git add <filename>
git add . (git add *)
git commit -a -m "Your commit message"
  -a => add/stage
  -m => commit message
git log
git clone https://github.com/sk12k/test-dev.git
git push
git pull
git pull <remotename> <branchname>
git pull origin master
git pull = git fetch + git merge
git remote
git remote -v
git remote add testdev https://github.com/sk12k/test-dev.git
Pull vs Clone => Clone is first time, Pull/Push is for all subsequent operations to keep your repository in Sync.

=============================
Branching and Merging
=============================

Why Branching?
  - Parallel Development
  - Isolated sandboxed environments for coding and development.

Commands:
git branch          => to see all the existing branches along with the current branch
git branch fa       => create a new branch with name "fa"
git checkout fa     => Switch to branch "fa"
git checkout -b fa  => create a new branch "fa" and switch to it.

## Merge fa branch with Master
git checkout master
git merge fa

## Merge Master with FA branch
git checkout fa
git merge master

=============================
Merge Conflicts
=============================

***Always do "git pull" before every "git push"***


- Merge 2 branches with conflicting changes
- Push to a remote branch with conflicting changes
